# Stock Manager

**Language:** `C# winForms`

### After download or clone the project:
1) Run `rebuild solution` to install all dependencies.
2) In the **Package Manager Console**, select the **StockManager.Storage** as the Default project and run `Update-Database` to create the `App.db.sqlite` file in `/StockManager` folder.

*The database will have a default user with the credentials, **username:** `Admin` and **password:** `admin`.*

**Notes:**

If the file `App.db.sqlite` isn't in the project **StockManager** 
    
*  Include it into the project.
*  Right click on it and go to properties.
*  Change the **Copy to Output Directory** to `Copy if newer`. With this changes, your DB file will be copied to project `/bin/debug` directory on the run, if it is newer.
*  Change the code that has been added to the file **StockManager.csproj** to be the following: 

    ````
    <None Include="App.db.sqlite" Condition="Exists('.\App.db.sqlite')">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
    ````

From now on, your application will save the data in the `/bin/debug/App.db.sqlite`. The `App.db.sqlite` outside the `/bin/debug` will remain with the initial values only.
